# Algorithms

## Structure

## Aim

The aim here is to implement as many algorithms as possible in multiple languages. This is partially an educational tool, but also to be used as code snippets in future.

## Web Pages

Each algorithm should have its own web page to explain the algorithms stats, such as Big-O notation. This could also be extended to a dashboard for algos, where they can be searched based on the problem scenario, or certain properties of a problem.
