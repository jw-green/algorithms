## Aim

To implement as many algorithms as possible in multiple languages. This is partially an educational tool, but also to be used as code snippets in future.

## Details Pages

Each algorithm has its own details page to explain the algorithm's stats, such as Big-O notation, and the concepts that it utilises. Under that is the implementations in other languages.
